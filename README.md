Basic Student Database Application using Flask, Oracle DB, Python, Jquery, Bootstrap, SQLiteDB

Python, Flask, Oracle instantclient, SQLite

Setup of oracle instaclient:

You need to download oracle instant client from oracle website, I have downloaded file named "instantclient-basic-windows.x64-19.12.0.0.0dbru" but anything should work. After extracting the file, you need to add the path path\to\instantclient-basic-windows.x64-19.12.0.0.0dbru\instantclient_19_12 to your system's environment variables to make it work.

python python_project_flask.py
